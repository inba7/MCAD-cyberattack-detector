# MCAD-cyberattack-detector
A Machine Learning Based Cyberattacks Detector in Software-Defined Networking for Healthcare Systems

The healthcare industry handles sensitive and important data that must be protected from unauthorized access. Software-defined networks (SDNs) are extensively implemented in healthcare systems to assure optimal resource utilization, security, network administration, and control. Due to the sensitivity of patient data, SDNs are exposed to a wide spectrum of intrusions despite their many benefits. These attacks harm the overall network performance and can lead to network failures that pose a risk to human lives. Therefore, we aim to propose a machine learning based cyber-attack detector (MCAD) for healthcare systems, by adapting a layer three (L3) learning switch to collect normal and abnormal traffic, and then deploy MCAD on the Ryu controller to analyse/neutralize the abnormal traffic.

Advantages of proposed method:
1.	Our work prioritizes cybersecurity by specifically addressing the detection of cyber-attacks within healthcare systems. This focus on security helps safeguard sensitive patient data and critical healthcare infrastructure from potential breaches and threats. 
2.	The machine learning-based cyber-attack detector is designed to identify a wide spectrum of cyber-attacks, providing a comprehensive defense against different types of threats, including intrusion attempts and unauthorized access.
3.	Our work leverages machine learning algorithms to efficiently detect cyber-attacks by adapting a layer three learning switch application. This approach optimizes the use of resources, making it well-suited for real-time detection without unnecessary strain on computational and energy resources.
4.	The focus on real-time cyber-attack detection allows our work to quickly identify and respond to threats as they occur. This can mitigate potential damage and minimize disruption within healthcare systems, which is essential for patient safety.
